Parallel level 1: Planes
	Nature: planes are detected by trials until a % of the scene is explained by planes, or max number of trials is hit (determine with threads?)
	Issue: Don't know how many planes. 

Parallel level 2: Trials
	Nature: each trial finds a possible plane
	Issue: number of trials is updated in runtime by the outlier ratio
	Solution: determine a minimum plane size relative to the point cloud size, give points a plane list property, valid planes fight for points.
	Will taking the largest planes that explain a % of the scene give the best solution?

Parallel level 3: Distance comparisons (up to 20ms serially in cube model, 9ms in parallel)
	Nature: chunk points to calculate distance with into threads
	Issue: requires signed integer for OpenMP, so not as robust. Currently loop variable is only added to though, so no occasion for it to drop below zero.
	Limit model number of points to signed long long max?


Other improvements:
	determine number of trials with s = 3, probability to aim for that so many trials with explain the % of the scene, and outlier ratio (updated?)
	
	determine number of planes automatically by % of the scene explained


BIG OLDE QUESTION - do I use something other than RANSAC? PROSAC, preemptive RANSAC... talk to Steven about this
