NOTES
have taken the space reallocation hit on the 4D vector: initializing unique empty vectors for each pointer is proving difficult
Would switch to a linked list, but to add points from the same vector in parallel requires element acces rather than just iterating
Solution could be to have a different parallel structure where cleary's rays are done in parallel, and access to the pushing vector is synched.
And then each cell has its points iterated through serially
But then checking which cells have been already added parallely is a pain...

Possible explanation for cleary's not working - planes BEYOND the bounding box not recognised
This impacts RANSAC when the edge of the bounding box is comprised of many points

CODE
test original maths version while vector pc is running
profile uniform to see where the time is
try different parallel location once other sections are written
compare row orderings if time


REPORT
Conclude on a trade-off where uniform space subdivision becomes more expensive
Rewrite intro focussing on flow
Leave conclusion for last
